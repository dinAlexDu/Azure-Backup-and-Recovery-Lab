# Azure Backup and Recovery Lab
---
**A Hands-on Lab for Configuring and Restoring Virtual Machine Backups in Azure**
---

This project demonstrates how to configure Azure Backup to protect Virtual Machines (VMs) and restore them from recovery points to ensure business continuity. The lab includes setting up a Recovery Services Vault, configuring backup policies, performing VM backups, and testing restored VM functionality.

## Project Objectives

- **Set up a Recovery Services Vault**  
  Create and configure a Recovery Services Vault to centrally manage VM backups.

- **Create Backup Policies**  
  Define automated backup policies for virtual machines, including frequency and retention periods.

- **Perform Manual and Scheduled Backups**  
  Execute both on-demand and scheduled backups for Azure virtual machines.

- **Restore Virtual Machines**  
  Recover VMs from previously created recovery points using the Azure Portal.

- **Test Connectivity and Functionality**  
  Validate the restored VMs by testing network connectivity and ensuring application functionality.

## Steps Implemented
1. **Create a Resource Group**  
   - Name: `BackupLabRG`  
   - Region: West Europe

2. **Create a Storage Account**  
   - Type: Standard  
   - Name: `backupstorageaccttest`

3. **Set Up a Recovery Services Vault**  
   - Name: `BackupVault`  
   - Associated Resource Group: `BackupLabRG`

4. **Configure Backup Policy**  
   - Frequency: Daily backup at 11:00 PM  
   - Retention: 180 days

5. **Backup Virtual Machines**  
   - VMs: `VM1-Backup`, `VM2-Backup`

6. **Restore a Virtual Machine**  
   - Type: Create a new VM  
   - Restored VM name: `VM2-Restored`
