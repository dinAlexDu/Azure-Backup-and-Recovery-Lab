# Azure Backup and Recovery Lab
---
A Hands-on Lab for Configuring and Restoring Virtual Machine Backups in Azure
---
This project demonstrates how to configure Azure Backup to protect Virtual Machines (VMs) and restore them from recovery points to ensure business continuity. The lab includes setting up a Recovery Services Vault, configuring backup policies, performing VM backups, and testing restored VM functionality.

## 🛠️ Project Objectives

- **Set up a Recovery Services Vault**  
  Create and configure a Recovery Services Vault to centrally manage VM backups.

- **Create Backup Policies**  
  Define automated backup policies for virtual machines, including frequency and retention periods.

- **Perform Manual and Scheduled Backups**  
  Execute both on-demand and scheduled backups for Azure virtual machines.

- **Restore Virtual Machines**  
  Recover VMs from previously created recovery points using the Azure Portal.

- **Test Connectivity and Functionality**  
  Validate the restored VMs by testing network connectivity and ensuring application functionality.
